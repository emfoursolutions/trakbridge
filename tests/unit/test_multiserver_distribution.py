ABOUTME: TDD test suite for multi-server distribution logic
ABOUTME: Tests single fetch â†’ multiple server distribution functionality

This test module follows the TDD specification for implementation,
testing the core business logic to use the many-to-many relationship schema
for distributing data from one API fetch to multiple TAK servers.

Key test scenarios:
- Single fetch with multiple server distribution
- Server failure isolation (one server fails, others continue)
- API call reduction verification (1 API call vs N API calls)
- Error handling and fallback scenarios
- Performance validation for large datasets
