ABOUTME: TDD integration tests for single fetch → multiple send workflow
ABOUTME: Tests end-to-end integration of multi-server distribution functionality

This integration test module follows the TDD specification for
testing the complete end-to-end workflow from GPS API fetch through
distribution to multiple TAK servers with real database operations.

Key integration scenarios:
- Complete single fetch → multi-server send workflow
- Real database many-to-many relationship operations
- Persistent COT service integration with multiple servers
- Performance validation under realistic conditions
- Error recovery and failover scenarios
