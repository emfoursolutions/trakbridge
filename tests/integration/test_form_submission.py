ABOUTME: Phase 2C TDD integration tests for multi-server form submission and processing
ABOUTME: Tests end-to-end integration of UI form handling with database operations

This integration test module follows the TDD specification for Phase 2C,
testing the complete integration from HTML form submission through route
processing to database relationship creation and management.

Key integration scenarios:
- Complete form submission workflow from UI to database
- Real database operations for many-to-many relationship management
- Error handling and rollback scenarios
- Backward compatibility with existing single-server forms
- Performance validation with multiple server assignments
