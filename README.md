# TrakBridge

A web application for bridging tracking devices and services to TAK (Team Awareness Kit) servers. Provides real-time data streaming from various GPS sources to TAK servers for situational awareness.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Integration**: Support for GPS trackers, OSINT platforms, and emergency management systems
- **Plugin Categorization**: Organized plugin system with OSINT, Tracker, and EMS categories
- **Authentication System**: Multi-provider authentication (Local, LDAP, OIDC) with role-based access control
- **TAK Server Management**: Configure multiple TAK server connections with certificate support
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Continuous data forwarding with health monitoring and circuit breaker protection
- **Web Interface**: Secure dashboard for stream management and monitoring with categorized plugin selection
- **Role-Based Access**: Viewer, User, Operator, and Admin roles with appropriate UI controls
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for adding new data sources with external plugin support
- **Enterprise Ready**: Multi-database support, SSL/TLS, backup & recovery, audit logging
- **Security Hardened**: Comprehensive security implementations including field-level encryption
- **Performance Optimized**: uvloop integration, connection pooling, intelligent caching (2-3x performance boost)
- **Single Worker Architecture**: Simplified deployment with single Hypercorn worker for improved efficiency and debugging
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated dashboard with queue metrics, stream health, and performance graphs
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Automatic failure recovery with intelligent retry mechanisms
- **Hot Configuration Reload**: Zero-downtime configuration changes with validation caching
- **Resource Management**: Memory optimization, leak prevention, and capacity monitoring

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Download setup files
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emfoursolutions/trakbridge/main/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emfoursolutions/trakbridge/refs/heads/main/scripts/setup.sh

# Setup and run
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh --enable-nginx --nginx-ssl yourdomain.com
docker-compose --profile postgres --profile nginx up -d
```

Access the web interface at `https://yourdomain.com`

**First-time login**:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `TrakBridge-Setup-2025!`
- You'll be forced to change the password on first logins

### Environment Configuration
All configuration is managed directly in the docker-compose.yml file. Edit the `x-environment` section to customize your deployment:

```yaml
# Edit these values in docker-compose.yml
x-environment: &common-environment
  # Application Settings
  FLASK_ENV: "production"
  USER_ID: "1000"  # Change if needed for filesystem permissions
  GROUP_ID: "1000"  # Change if needed for filesystem permissions
  
  # Database Configuration (choose one)
  DB_TYPE: "postgresql"  # postgresql, mysql, or sqlite
  DB_HOST: "postgres"
  DB_NAME: "trakbridge"
  DB_USER: "trakbridge"
  
  # LDAP Authentication (set LDAP_ENABLED to "true" to enable)
  LDAP_ENABLED: "false"
  LDAP_SERVER: "ldap://your-ad-server.company.com"  # Update for your LDAP server
  LDAP_BIND_DN: "CN=trakbridge,OU=Service Accounts,DC=company,DC=com"  # Update for your domain
  
  # OIDC/SSO Authentication (set OIDC_ENABLED to "true" to enable)
  OIDC_ENABLED: "false"
  OIDC_ISSUER: "https://your-identity-provider.com"  # Update for your OIDC provider
  OIDC_CLIENT_ID: "trakbridge-client"  # Update with your client ID
  OIDC_REDIRECT_URI: "https://trakbridge.company.com/auth/oidc/callback"  # Update for your domain
```

#### Docker Secrets Setup
Sensitive credentials are managed through Docker secrets. These are created by the setup.sh script.
If LDAP or OIDC authentication backends are being used the password / OIDC client secret must be inserted into their respective secret file.

```bash
# LDAP password (if using LDAP authentication)
echo "your-ldap-bind-password" > secrets/ldap_bind_password

# OIDC client secret (if using OIDC authentication)
echo "your-oidc-client-secret" > secrets/oidc_client_secret
```

### Python Development

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd trakbridge
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install .
hypercorn app.py  # Single worker deployment for optimal performance
```

## Basic Usage

1. **Login**: Use default admin credentials (change password on first login)
2. **Create Users**: Set up user accounts with appropriate roles (Admin â†’ User Management)
3. **Configure TAK Server**: Add your TAK server details and certificates
4. **Create Stream**: Select from categorized data sources (OSINT, Tracker, EMS) and configure credentials
5. **Start Streaming**: Monitor real-time data flow to your TAK server
