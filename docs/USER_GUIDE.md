### Stream Configuration Best Practices

#### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose and source
- Include team, unit, or operational context
- Examples: "Alpha_Team_InReach", "Command_Post_SPOT", "Intel_Feed_Ukraine"

#### Refresh Intervals
- **GPS Trackers**: 300-600 seconds (5-10 minutes) for normal operations
- **OSINT Sources**: 600-1800 seconds (10-30 minutes) for intelligence feeds
- **Emergency Operations**: 60-300 seconds (1-5 minutes) for critical situations
- **Consider server load**: More frequent updates require more system resources

#### Security Considerations
- Use strong, unique passwords for device accounts
- Regularly rotate credentials according to security policy
- Enable two-factor authentication where supported
- Avoid sharing credentials between multiple streams

## Managing Existing Streams

### Stream Status Monitoring

#### Dashboard Overview
The main dashboard shows all streams with key status indicators:

- **Green Circle**: Stream running normally, data flowing
- **Yellow Warning**: Stream active but with warnings or errors
- **Red Error**: Stream failed or stopped, requires attention
- **Gray Inactive**: Stream disabled or not started

#### Detailed Stream Information
Click any stream to view detailed information:

- **Last Update**: When data was last received from source
- **Events Sent**: Count of messages sent to TAK server
- **Current Status**: Detailed status message and any errors
- **Configuration Summary**: Quick overview of stream settings

### Stream Operations

#### Starting and Stopping Streams
- **Start Stream**: Click the play button to begin data flow
- **Stop Stream**: Click the pause button to temporarily halt stream  
- **Restart Stream**: Stop and start to reset connection and clear errors
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple streams for simultaneous control

#### Editing Stream Configuration
1. **Click "Edit"** on the stream you want to modify
2. **Update configuration** fields as needed
3. **Test connection** if credentials or endpoints changed  
4. **Save changes** - stream will restart automatically if active

#### Stream Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:

**Connection Errors**:
- Verify credentials haven't expired or changed
- Check network connectivity to data source
- Confirm data source service is operational

**Authentication Failures**:
- Re-enter username and password
- Check for account lockouts or suspensions
- Verify two-factor authentication isn't required

**No Data Received**:
- Check if source device is powered on and transmitting
- Verify share settings are enabled on source account
- Confirm refresh interval isn't too aggressive

**TAK Server Errors**:
- Verify TAK server is operational and accepting connections
- Check network connectivity between TrakBridge and TAK server
- Confirm TAK server certificates are valid and trusted

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring Tasks

#### Daily Checks
- Review stream status on dashboard
- Verify active streams are receiving data
- Check for any error messages or warnings
- Monitor data flow to TAK servers

#### Weekly Reviews
- Review stream performance and data quality
- Check for any configuration changes needed
- Verify credentials are still valid and functional
- Review any system notifications or alerts

### Data Quality Management

#### Understanding Data Types
Different plugins provide different types of location data:

**GPS Trackers**:
- Precise coordinate data with timestamps
- Battery and signal strength information
- Movement and speed calculations
- Emergency activation status

**OSINT Sources**:
- Situational reports and incident data
- Geographic features and landmarks
- Analyzed intelligence products
- Public domain information

#### Data Validation
- **Coordinate Accuracy**: GPS data should show reasonable precision
- **Timestamp Currency**: Data should be recent and properly timestamped
- **Source Attribution**: Data should clearly indicate origin and reliability
- **Format Consistency**: Data should maintain consistent formatting

### Performance Optimization

#### Refresh Interval Tuning
- **High-Priority Operations**: Shorter intervals (1-5 minutes) for critical data
- **Normal Operations**: Standard intervals (5-10 minutes) for routine monitoring
- **Background Monitoring**: Longer intervals (15-30 minutes) for non-urgent data

#### Resource Management
- Monitor system performance during peak operations
- Adjust refresh intervals during high-load periods
- Balance data currency needs with system capacity
- Coordinate with administrators for system optimization

## User Profile Management

### Password Management
1. **Navigate to Profile** (top-right menu)
2. **Click "Change Password"**
3. **Enter current password** for verification
4. **Set new password** meeting security requirements
5. **Confirm new password** and save changes

### Profile Information
- **Update contact information** for notifications and communication
- **Set timezone preferences** for accurate data display

### Data Flow Problems
**Stream shows active but no data**:
- Verify data source is transmitting (check device status)
- Confirm source account sharing settings are enabled
- Check for data source service outages or maintenance
- Review stream logs for detailed error messages

**Data appears delayed**:
- Check refresh interval settings (may be too long)
- Verify network connectivity and latency
- Monitor system performance during peak hours
- Consider adjusting polling frequency

### TAK Server Integration
**Data not appearing in TAK**:
- Verify TAK server is operational and accessible
- Check TrakBridge to TAK server connectivity
- Confirm TAK server is configured to accept external data
- Review TAK server logs for connection errors

**Coordinate system mismatches**:
- Verify coordinate system settings match TAK requirements
- Check datum and projection configurations
- Confirm data source provides coordinates in expected format
- Contact TAK server administrator for coordinate system requirements
