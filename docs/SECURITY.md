# TrakBridge Security Guide

## Overview

TrakBridge implements comprehensive security controls designed for enterprise environments. This document serves as the central hub for all security-related documentation and provides an overview of the security architecture and best practices.

## Security Philosophy

TrakBridge follows defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of security:

- **Secure by Default**: All security features enabled out of the box
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Every request authenticated and authorized
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions required for operation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security events logged and auditable

## Security Architecture Overview

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Multi-Provider Authentication**: Local database, LDAP/Active Directory, OIDC/SSO
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Viewer, User, Operator, and Admin roles with granular permissions
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with automatic cleanup and timeout
- **Password Policies**: Configurable password strength requirements and rotation
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation for programmatic access

### Data Protection
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive configuration data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- **Secure Transmission**: All communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and handling of API keys and passwords
- **Database Security**: Encrypted database connections and parameterized queries

### Input Validation and Security
- **Comprehensive JSON Validation**: DoS protection through size, depth, and structure limits
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage throughout
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and Content Security Policy headers
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery tokens for all state-changing operations

### Container and Deployment Security
- **Non-Root Execution**: Docker containers run as non-privileged user by default
- **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies and container images
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only necessary services and ports exposed
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Environment-based secrets with no hardcoded credentials

## Security Configuration

### Production Security Checklist

#### Essential Security Setup
1. **Change Default Credentials**: Modify admin password on first login
2. **Generate Encryption Key**: Create strong 32-character encryption key
3. **Enable HTTPS**: Configure TLS certificates for production
4. **Configure Authentication**: Set up LDAP/OIDC if required
5. **Review Firewall Rules**: Restrict access to necessary ports only

#### Advanced Security Configuration
1. **Enable Audit Logging**: Configure comprehensive audit trail
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Implement security event monitoring and alerting
3. **Configure Backup Encryption**: Encrypt backup files and storage
4. **Implement Network Segmentation**: Isolate TrakBridge in appropriate network zones
5. **Regular Security Updates**: Establish update schedule for security patches

### Authentication Configuration

#### Local Authentication (Default)
```bash
# Secure password policy configuration
export PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=12
export PASSWORD_REQUIRE_MIXED_CASE=true
export PASSWORD_REQUIRE_NUMBERS=true
export PASSWORD_REQUIRE_SYMBOLS=true
export SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=480
```

#### LDAP/Active Directory Integration
See [Authentication Guide](AUTHENTICATION.md) for complete LDAP setup with security considerations.

#### OIDC/SSO Integration
Detailed configuration in [Docker Authentication Setup](DOCKER_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md) with security best practices.

### Encryption Configuration

#### Field-Level Encryption
```bash
# Generate secure encryption key (32 characters)
openssl rand -base64 32 | cut -c1-32
export TRAKBRIDGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-32-char-key"
```

#### HTTPS/TLS Configuration
```bash
# Automated SSL setup with Let's Encrypt
./setup.sh --enable-nginx --nginx-ssl yourdomain.com

# Manual certificate configuration
export SSL_CERT_PATH="/app/certs/server.crt"
export SSL_KEY_PATH="/app/certs/server.key"
```

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

#### Docker Security
- Use official TrakBridge images from verified sources
- Run containers as non-root user (default behavior)
- Mount secrets as read-only volumes
- Regularly update base images and dependencies
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive environment variables

#### Network Security
- Deploy behind reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) with proper security headers
- Use TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites
- Implement network segmentation and firewall rules
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Restrict administrative access by IP address

#### System Security
- Keep host operating system updated with security patches

- Enable system audit logging and monitoring
- Regular vulnerability scanning of the deployment
- Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems

### Application Security

#### User Management
- Enforce strong password policies
- Regular review and cleanup of user accounts
- Implement account lockout protection
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Use principle of least privilege for role assignments
