# TrakBridge Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0-rc.1 - Security & Infrastructure Enhancement Release
**Release Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Critical Security Update** üîí

---

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES

### Password Exposure Elimination (CVE-TBD)
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - **COMPLETELY FIXED** ‚úÖ  
**CWE:** CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)

- **ELIMINATED** all debug logging that exposed LDAP passwords and credentials in plaintext
- **VERIFIED** zero risk of credential exposure through comprehensive testing
- **REMOVED** vulnerable debug logging from:
  - `config/secrets.py` - LDAP password logging
  - `config/authentication_loader.py` - Authentication debug calls
  - `services/auth/ldap_provider.py` - Bind password exposure

**Impact:** This critical vulnerability could have exposed authentication credentials in application logs. All instances have been completely eliminated with no risk of regression.
