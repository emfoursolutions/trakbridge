ðŸ“¦ v1.0.0-beta.3 â€“ First Public Beta
This release introduces several key improvements and new features as we move toward a more flexible and maintainable plugin-based CoT processing system.

âœ¨ Added
CoT Type Configuration
You can now set the CoT Type dynamically, either per feed or for the entire stream, allowing greater control over how data is interpreted and routed.

Deepstate Map Plugin
A new plugin has been added to ingest and process Deepstate map data for CoT output.

ðŸ”§ Changed
Garmin Plugin Refactor
The Garmin plugin has been refactored to remove redundant functions and methods. Timestamp handling and KML parsing have been centralized, improving consistency and simplifying maintenance.

ðŸ›  Improved
cot_service Logging
Logging within cot_service has been rationalized to reduce unnecessary output and improve debugging clarity.
